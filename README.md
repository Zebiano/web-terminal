# Web-terminal

Emulate using a terminal on the Web. Obviously, it's not a 'real' terminal, and you have to code everything yourself. It's just meant to *look* like a terminal.

## But why?

I was creating some puzzles and enigmas, and thought about using a terminal as part of it, to create some interesting challenges. I needed a bare-bones and pretty terminal-looking UI for the Web. I didn't want to use any frameworks or fancy things, I just wanted to quickly create one. Luckily, I found several online, and [this one](https://github.com/twanmulder/portfolio-terminal) caught my eye the most. So I decided to fork it and adapt it to my needs. Feel free to use it for your projects!

## Features

- No external dependencies
- Can require a password to login
- Existing commands: `help`, `clear`
- Up and down arrows to cycle between last used commands

---

Please don't judge the code, I really just wanted something functional that was easy to implement and simply works.
